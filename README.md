## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
Initial Release
- At a glance info pertaining to your tenant and your current session
- Added the ability to open your tenant directly in the SailPoint VSCode extension (https://github.com/yannick-beot-sp/vscode-sailpoint-identitynow)
- Inlcuded helpful Shortcuts and Quick links for IdentityNow:
Compass Search
Book Links
Transform Guides
User Level Access Matrix
V3/Beta API references
A connector reference quick sheet
A quick link to open a support ticket

- A quick and simple generator to generate a bundle of IndentityNow objects that you may be having issues with at a particular moment, this can be copied directly into a support ticket and will aid in issue location and diagnosis


## Road Map
- Add additional Object categories for the support bundle generator()
- Maybe rething the generator UI formatting?
- Add some simpler standard/common API calls customers use often
